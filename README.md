## Background information: 

The restaurant industry in America was a wonderfully expanding, $12 million industry by 2019, facing changing dynamics after covid hit, although it started to revive back in 2021. Also, in due course of time, food deliveries saw a steady rise, and combined, these 2 sections of the food industry have been forecasted to continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the future. 

As the US continues to have a cosmopolitan and diverse culture and set of people residing for education, work and travel, it becomes increasingly important for restaurants to be able to serve to them what they expect when they dine-in or take-out.

## Research Questions:
In this project, we applied EDA, sentiment analysis, and classification tree to explore two questions:

+ What are the restaurant features that customers perceive as the most important for foreign cuisines in the US? 
+ For the most popular restaurant serving foreign cuisines in the US, what are its key aspects that drive the overall customer perception? 


<br>

## Conclusions and Recommendations: 


In this project, we explored the restaurant customer reviews across various foreign cuisines in the US. We identified the features that restaurants should pay attention to, and revealed the deeper aspects that drive customer perceptions to the most popular restaurant. To conclude our findings based on the research questions: <br>
<br>
We identified that taste and authenticity of food, as well as restaurant service and environment are the most important features that drive positive customer experiences. The cooking methods, especially certain food flavor of specific cuisines, are the most common ways that drive negative customer perceptions. It can suggest multiple strategies to restaurants serving foreign cuisines in the US. If the restaurants are going to attract more customers and increase the customer base, they should focus on improving the taste, restaurant service and environment. The positive customer reviews, word-of-mouth, can act as a social marketing promotion and make the restaurant more attractable. If the restaurants are going to keep the existing customers and increase the customer loyalty, the restaurants should follow closely on negative customer experience for further improvements. For example, as a Japanese restaurant, it could figure out ways to reduce blandness of food. <br>
<br>
By looking at the single restaurant that received the most customer reviews, we revealed more specific aspects that drive customer perceptions to the most popular restaurant. The restaurant service, punctuality, food diversity, flavor, and serving approach matter a lot. They can consider whether to continue serving some specific items or not. They can also adjust the amount of food preparation and serving portion based on the insights of customer reviews. Taking the most popular French restaurant in our dataset as an example, the serving amount of martini can be reduced. <br>
